1- The **device driver** 

- tells the device controller what to do by loading instructions into its registers.

2-The **device controller** 

- reads these instructions and decides how to handle the operation.
- It transfers data between the device and its internal buffer.
- When the operation finishes, the **device controller** notifies the device driver via an interrupt.
- Finally, the **device driver** informs the operating system that the task is done.
- ***Examble***
    - **Initiating the Task**:
        - The operating system (OS) asks the **device driver** to read a file from the hard disk.
        - The device driver sends a "read" command to the **Command Register** of the disk controller.
    - **Processing the Command**:
        - The **disk controller** looks at the command in its register and begins reading the requested data from the disk.
        - The data is temporarily stored in the controller’s **buffer**.
    - **Completion Notification**:
        - When the read operation is complete, the disk controller sends an **interrupt** to the CPU, saying, "I’m done!"
    - **Returning Data to the OS**:
        - The device driver retrieves the data from the disk controller’s buffer and hands it over to the operating system.
        - The OS then processes the file (e.g., displays its content to the user).

**Registers in Device Controllers**
These registers control and monitor the device:

**Data Register**: Temporarily holds the data being transferred.
**Command Register:** Receives commands from the CPU (e.g., read, write).
**Status Register:** Provides information about the device’s status (e.g., ready, busy, error).
